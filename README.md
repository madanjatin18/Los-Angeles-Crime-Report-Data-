Visually understanding Crime Rate Patterns in LA

## Dataset Overview and Structure

The dataset titled "Crime Data from 2020 to Present" reflects incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles dating back to 2020. The data is transcribed from original crime reports and contains a total of 800,000+ observations up to July 10, 2023[3]. The dataset is updated weekly and is publicly accessible[5].

Each row in the dataset corresponds to a particular crime incident. The dataset contains 28 attributes, including a four-digit code that represents a sub-area within a Geographic Area (Rpt Dist No), an indicator of the crime committed (Crm Cd), and the street address of the crime incident rounded to the nearest hundred block to maintain anonymity (LOCATION)[13].

## Best Tools for Visualizing Crime Data

There are several tools available for visualizing crime data. Power BI is one such tool that has been used to create geo-map visualizations of the Los Angeles crime data[3]. This tool allows for the creation of interactive visualizations that can be filtered by the end-user.

Another tool is the Tableau, which is acceptable in different organizations.

## Visualization Examples

Visualizing crime data can provide valuable insights into crime patterns and trends. For instance, using Power BI, one can create a geo-map visualization that displays the locations of various crimes in Los Angeles[3]. This can help identify areas with high crime rates.

Another example is the use of graph visualization to explore and understand crime data at scale. Graphs can reveal trends and give insight into relationships between people, times, and locations[16].

In addition, time series charts can be used to visualize crime data over time, helping to identify patterns or trends in crime rates[14].

To create these visualizations, you would first need to import the dataset into your chosen tool (e.g., Power BI, LEARCAT, SpotCrime). Then, you can select the relevant attributes (e.g., crime type, location, time) to include in your visualization. Depending on the tool, you may also be able to add filters or other interactive features to your visualization.

Remember, the goal of visualizing this data is to provide a clear, easy-to-understand representation of crime patterns and trends in Los Angeles. This can help residents, tourists, politicians, and others gain further insights and perhaps learn some crime statistics[3].
